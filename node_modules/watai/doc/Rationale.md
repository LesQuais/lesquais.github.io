Why you should use Watai
========================

Intended users
--------------

Watai is aimed at websites and web applications that are complex enough to benefit from a little higher investment up front for the safety of a complete regression detection suite.

Since the same tests can be run in almost any browser*, any webapp can also easily check cross-browser functional support.

_* any browser supported by WebDriver, i.e. practically [all browsers](http://seleniumhq.org/about/platforms.html)_


Strengths
---------

- Enforcement of a highly decoupled architecture for maintainable tests.
- Ability to do black-box testing of web components.
- Simple cascading configuration makes sharing tests across environments very easy.
- High quality developer documentation (user documentation coming as things stabilize). That means you could _actually_ fix things or add functionality and do not have to depend on the original developer.
- Out-of-the-box async operations (AJAXâ€¦) support, as well as much more resilience than WebDriver, whose failures are wrapped.
- Helpful error messages.


Limitations
-----------

Watai, like any **integration-level** testing framework, can not be considered a proper testing strategy alone.

You should have unit tests for your application, both on the server- and on the client-side. If your application is complex, adding functional-level tests is a good thing.

Integration-level testing validates _scenarios_, expected behavior, but cannot help in pinpointing a failure origin as much as unit testing can.
Moreover, even though Watai does its best to seriously improve the process of writing and maintaining such high-level tests, since they run across so many components, they will always require more effort than the kind of direct code access unit tests provide.

Watai has the same limitations as any other integration-level testing tool: it has to be used at the proper stage, and to validate reasonably complex behavior to add value.
